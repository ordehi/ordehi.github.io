It had to be done, a `Hello, World!` post. Just as every first program a learner writes outputs "Hello, World!" in some way; in the necessity of having something here other than the example welcome post Jekyll comes with, this is

> My Obligatory "Hello, World!" post

Obligatory is a fun word, it's like mandatory or compulsory, but sounds and it's more difficult to pronounce. I should know, I'm not a native speaker, so when a word isn't your standard "hello" and it's more akin to "world," I might end up butchering the r's.

This is how "Hello, World!" looks like in Jekyll (Ruby):

{% highlight ruby %}
def hello_world()
puts "Hello, World!"
end
hello_world()
#=> prints 'Hello, World!' to STDOUT. Who would've thought?
{% endhighlight %}

There's a pretty cool way to interpolate links into text which I'm using here to link my [Github profile][github-profile], mostly so that I don't forget how to use this neat trick. I tend to forget small stuff like this if I don't use some sort of mnemonic approach to my actions. By the way, if you click the link it'll open in the same window, so please do come back!

Thanks for reading this useful pointless post. I hope to put out more pointed stuff as I learn whatever it is I'm learning at the time.

Cheers!
